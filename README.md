# Template Structure
Some folders will have the contents ignored via the .gitignore file. The folder structure, however, is maintained through the use of .keep files and exceptions in the .gitignore.

## Code
Folder to hold scripts used for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis. Subfolders can be created for further organization if needed.

## Data
Folder to hold manual csv files if needed. There is a subfolder for raw and clean files. Files in this folder will not be pushed to GitHub due to the .gitignore file.

## Deliverables
Folder to hold presentations or writeups. The contents of the folder will not be pushed to GitHub due to the .gitignore file. 

## Roadmap
The README in this folder can serve as the project outline or roadmap. This can be a place to list phases of the project, details of that phase, desired goal for the phase, and key takeaways.

## Scrap Folder
The contents of this folder are ignored by the .gitignore (except .keep) and is intended to store messy or exploratory files that do not need to be pushed to the repository.

## SQL Queries
Folder to save sql queries that may need to be called into scripts or saved for reproducibility.

## Visuals
Folder to store visuals produced by your code. Has two subfolders, exploratory and final. The contents of the exploratory subfolder will not be pushed to GitHub due to the .gitignore file. Visuals in the 'final' folder will be pushed so save with caution.
