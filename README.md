# Template Structure
Some folders will have the contents ignored via the .gitignore file. The folder structure, however, is maintained through the use of .keep files and exceptions in the .gitignore.

## Code
Folder to hold scripts used for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis. Subfolders can be created for further organization if needed.

## Data
Folder to hold manual csv files if needed. There is a subfolder for raw and clean files. Files in this folder will not be pushed to GitHub due to the .gitignore file.

## Deliverables
Folder to hold presentations or writeups. The contents of the folder will not be pushed to GitHub due to the .gitignore file. 

## Scrap Folder

## SQL Queries
Folder to save sql queries that may need to be called into scripts or saved for reproducibility.

## Visuals
Folder to store visuals produced by your code. Has two subfolders, exploratory and final. The contents of the subfolders will not be pushed to GitHub due to the .gitignore file. If you would like to push final visuals then please adjust the .gitignore for your repo.
