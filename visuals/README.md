# Visuals

## Exploratory
This folder is a placeholder for users to keep exploratory visuals on their local repo without them being pushed to the remote repo. The .keep file is used to maintain folder structure.

## Final
This folder should be used for final visualizations you wish to share with the remote repo. These will be pushed so save to this folder with caution.
